üß† Machine Learning Model
Risk Assessment Factors

Transaction Amount: Higher amounts increase risk score
Time of Transaction: Unusual hours (before 6 AM or after 10 PM)
Device Recognition: New/unrecognized devices
Location Analysis: Transactions from new locations
Receiver Status: Unknown recipients increase risk
Historical Patterns: Based on user's transaction history

Model Performance

Algorithm: Logistic Regression with class balancing
Features: Amount, time, device, location, receiver status
Accuracy: Optimized for fraud detection with minimal false positives
